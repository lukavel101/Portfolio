    <!-- Yatzy Game Summary and Technical Documentation -->
    <h2>YATZY GAME SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>
        The Yatzyy game was a game I designed based of the game yatzy players would follow the same rules as a yatzy game. Some of the features I added were music to allow for the users to listen to music, and I created some dice animations to make the game feel more authentic and real. Some of the challenges I faced was displaying the scores and calculating them.
